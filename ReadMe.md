# Exploratory Data Analysis of Restaurant Orders

## Project Overview
This project involves data cleaning and the exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a quarter's worth of orders from a fictitious restaurant serving international cuisine. The goal is to understand the ordering patterns, identify the most and least popular items, and derive insights that can inform business decisions such as menu development and marketing strategies.

## Data Description
The data is copyright free and distributed by Maven Analytics.
The data for this analysis is stored in two CSV files:

1. **MenuTimes.csv**: Contains details about the menu items including their type, name, and price.
2. **OrderDetails.csv**: Contains order details such as the date and time of each order and the items ordered.

## Tools and Technologies
- **SQL Server**: To store, manage, and query the data.
- **CSV Files**: The initial data format, to be imported into SQL Server.
- **SQL**: The language used for querying the database.

## Conclusion
This EDA will provide valuable insights into customer preferences, spending habits, and peak ordering times. By leveraging this information,
the restaurant can optimize its menu offerings, improve customer satisfaction, and increase profitability.
